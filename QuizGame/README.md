# QuizGame

This is our final project of Software 2 in Metropolia UAS.

***INTRODUCTION***

As we want to increase the awareness of people about our world pollution problems, we create a quiz game where a player will need to answer quiz relating to environment. These questions will be related to the chosen country.
We hope that after playing the game, a player will have more understand about our world.

These are the stacks we use:
FrontEnd: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT
Backend: MySQL, PYTHON, FLASK

How to deploy:

- Activate the virtual environment (venv)
- Install all required package:
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- cd to `src` folder
  - `cd \back_end\src`

- deploy flask server
  - `flask run --debug`
